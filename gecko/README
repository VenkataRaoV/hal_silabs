Silicon Labs Gecko HAL
######################

Origin:
   Silicon Labs Gecko SDK
   https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/simplicity-studio

Version:
   v3.1.2

Purpose:
   Add support for Silicon Labs EXX32 SoCs

Description:
   This code component is used to add Zephyr support for Silicon Labs EXX32 SoCs.
   To speed up the development process it is based on the Silicon Labs HAL.

   The Silicon Labs HAL is split into SoC-specific folders. They share the 
   Peripheral Support library.

   The following folders are imported:
   platform/Device/SiliconLabs/$(GECKO_DEVICE)
   platform/emlib
   platform/common
   platform/service/device_init
   platform/service/hfxo_manager
   platform/service/power_manager
   platform/service/sleeptimer
   hardware/board

Dependencies:
   This source code depends on headers and sources from Zephyr:
   ext/hal/cmsis

How to update
+++++++++++++

  * Start Simplicity Studio
  * Start the Package Manager
  * Install the new 32-bit MCU SDK version
  * The installation directory is <Simplicity Studio Path>/developer/sdks/gecko_sdk_suite/<version>
  * Replace the necessary files in ext/hal/silabs/gecko/Device, ext/hal/silabs/gecko/emlib for all EXX32 SoCs.
  * Replace the files in ext/hal/silabs/gecko/common, ext/hal/silabs/gecko/service, and ext/hal/silabs/gecko/board for EFR32BG22 SoCs.
  * Ensure that the CMakeLists and Kconfig files match the new version of the Gecko SDK
  
What is different in EFR32BG22
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  * To keep the device initialization similar to the sequence in simplicity studio, following directories are imported from GSDK.
    platform/service/device_init
    hardware/board
  * hardware/board/src/sl_board_default_init.c file is generated from hardware/board/src/sl_board_default_init.c.jinja file.
  * platform/service/device_init/src/sl_device_init_clocks.c in platform/service/device_init/src is generated from .jinja file 
    available in platform/service/device_init/template.
  * These .c files are generated from .jinja file using simplicity studio and are available under "autogen" folder
    inside the project. These files should be merged with the existing files.
  * platform/service/power_manager and platform/service/hfxo_manager are used for power management functionality.
  * platform/service/sleeptimer is used in power management functionality. This is built on top of RTCC driver for EFR32BG22 SoCs.
